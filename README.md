# Project description 
- Users can place points on the map giving reviews of their favorite smaller businesses that they have visited in the Seattle area. Possibly add a filter to sort businesses based on business type (e.g., restaurants, bookstores, art galleries)  for a more user-friendly application.
- Possibly include images in their reviews like how Yelp formats their user suggestions but on a map instead
- Gives small businesses a higher chance to be selected because of the Top-Down view of the map, with no big signs drawing people to large businesses.

# Project Goal

# Project significance and broader impacts
- Benefit: Supporting Local Economies by raising small businesses' profile and drawing in additional clients thus the project can have a big positive impact on them. Consequently, this can support the regional economy, generate employment opportunities, and foster community growth. We also believe that this project will help emphasize how we support our local businesses while at the same time preserving the unique cultural identity of the developing city.
- Impact: Unintended prejudices: User-generated evaluations run the danger of inadvertent prejudice, which could have a disproportionately negative effect on some firms. In order to reduce premature content exposures, we will attempt to use moderation procedures to weed out any offensive or prejudiced content. Promote varied involvement to guarantee a wide variety of viewpoints. Lastly, ​​we will be highlighting a preferable method in how we choose our leisure activities at the same time reducing the carbon footprint of the area due to shorter supply chains.
